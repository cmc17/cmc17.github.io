**Title of the talk:** Coping with dynamical structures for useful applications of membrane computing

Coping with dynamical structures turns out to be both a challenging 
task but also a crucial clue in understanding, fine-grained modelling, 
and utilisation of biological and biologically inspired information 
processing. Principles of molecular computing are mainly based on 
modifiable spatial and topological arrangements in different forms, 
contexts, and scales ranging from nanoscopic surface shapes up to 
complex macroscopic behavioural patterns. From a composition-oriented 
point of view, we identify four levels in which dynamical structures 
essentially occur: (1) the molecular level, (2) the level of reaction 
network modules, (3) the level of membranes, and (4) the higher-order 
organism and population level. Alongside this hierarchy, we present 
corresponding P system frameworks together with application case studies 
and usefulness of the results for systems biology, bionics, engineering, 
and computer science.

**Title of the talk:** Eco-evo dynamics and the role of cellular computing

In the commons, communities whose growth depends on public good, individuals often rely on simple strategies to decide whether to contribute to the shared resource (at risk of exploitation by free-riders, i.e., cheaters). This issue is also present in cellular populations. In this talk I will discuss how cellular decision-making can be a crucial factor to facilitate the sustainable growth of cellular populations. Results will be discussed with simple computational models and experimental data obtained with synthetic cells.
