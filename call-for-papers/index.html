        <h2 id="scope-and-location">SCOPE AND LOCATION</h2>
        <p>The Conference on Membrane Computing (CMC) series started in 2000 as the Workshop on Multiset Processing. The first Workshop on Membrane Computing was organized in Curtea de Arges, Romania, in 2001. In 2010 it was transformed into a conference, CMC11. The last edition, CMC16, was held in Valencia, Spain, in 2015. Nowadays a Steering Committee takes care of the continuation of the CMC series which is organized under the auspices of the European Molecular Computing Consortium (EMCC).</p>
        <p>CMC17 is the 17th edition of the International Conference on Membrane Computing series. The conference will take place at Università degli Studi di Milano - Bicocca, in Milan, Italy. Milan is located in the north of Italy, and is one of the most active cities in Italy concerning both commerce and cultural events. Milan is very well known for fashion; however, the city also provides an impressive offer of museums, art exhibitions, theaters, and cultural events. The climate is mediterranean, with mild winters and hot summers. Italian food is also well known and appreciated in the World.</p>
        <p>The goal of CMC17 is to bring together researchers working in membrane computing and related fields, in a friendly atmosphere enhancing communication,cooperation and continuing the tradition of the past meetings. Membrane computing (P systems theory) is an area of computer science aiming to abstract computing ideas and models from the structure and the functioning of living cells, as well as from the way the cells are organized in tissues or higher order structures.</p>
        <h2 id="conference-format">CONFERENCE FORMAT</h2>
        <p>This edition will have the following format. It will consist of: (1) one day dedicated to reports on specific topics or results published during the last year in other conferences or scientific journals, (2) three days of conference with invited speakers and short and long contribution talks according to the submission of works and the reviews of the Program Committee, and (3) an Interaction Day similar in spirit to the Brainstorming Week on Membrane Computing (BWMC) that is usually organized in Sevilla every year, where the participants will work in a collaborative way to attack open problems and propose new approaches, problems and results.</p>
        <h2 id="submission-of-papers">SUBMISSION OF PAPERS</h2>
        <p>Authors are invited to submit papers presenting original, unpublished research as a PDF document. There are two tracks for submission:</p>
        <ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
        <li>full paper (of a reasonable length),</li>
        <li>extended abstract for poster presentation (maximum four pages). Typical extended abstracts present significant work-in-progress, late-breaking results, or initial self-dependent contributions of students new in the field.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Only electronic submissions are accepted. Papers should be written in LaTeX and formatted according to the usual LNCS article style which can be downloaded at Springer's LNCS website <a href="http://www.springer.com/lncs">http://www.springer.com/lncs</a>. Please, include all source files as well as all additional files (figures etc.), and also attach a PDF version of the submission.</p>
        <p>Submissions have to be sent through the EasyChair web Page</p>
        <p><a href="https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=cmc17">https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=cmc17</a></p>
