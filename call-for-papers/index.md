Call for papers [<img src="/media/pdf-icon.svg" alt="PDF format" height=32 width=32 style="vertical-align:middle;">](/call-for-papers/CMC17-cfp.pdf)
===============

Scope and location
------------------

The  Conference  on  Membrane  Computing  (CMC)  series started in 2000 as the 
Workshop on Multiset Processing. The first Workshop on Membrane  Computing was
organized  in  Curtea  de  Arges, Romania, in 2001. In 2010 it was transformed
into a  conference,  CMC11.  The  last edition, CMC16,  was held  in Valencia, 
Spain, in 2015.  Nowadays a Steering Committee  takes care of the continuation 
of  the  CMC  series  which  is  organized  under the auspices of the European 
Molecular Computing Consortium (EMCC).

CMC17 is the 17th edition of the International Conference on Membrane Computing
series.  The conference  will  take place at Università degli Studi di Milano -
Bicocca, in Milan, Italy. Milan is located in the north of Italy, and is one of
the most  active cities in Italy concerning  both commerce and cultural events.
Milan  is very  well known  for fashion;  however, the city  also  provides  an
impressive  offer  of museums, art exhibitions,  theaters, and cultural events.
The climate is  mediterranean, with mild winters and hot summers.  Italian food
is also well known and appreciated in the World.

The goal of CMC17 is to bring together researchers working in membrane computing
and related fields, in a friendly atmosphere enhancing communication,cooperation
and continuing the tradition of the past meetings. Membrane computing (P systems
theory) is  an area of computer science  aiming  to abstract computing ideas and
models from the  structure  and the functioning of living cells, as well as from
the way the cells are organized in tissues or higher order structures.

Conference format
-----------------

This edition  will have the following  format.  It will consist of: (1) one day
dedicated  to reports on specific topics  or results published  during the last
year in other conferences or scientific journals,  (2) three days of conference
with invited speakers  and short  and long contribution  talks according to the
submission  of works  and the reviews  of  the  Program  Committee,  and (3) an
Interaction  Day  similar in spirit  to  the  Brainstorming  Week  on  Membrane
Computing (BWMC)  that is  usually  organized in Sevilla  every year, where the
participants  will work  in a collaborative  way to attack  open  problems  and
propose new approaches, problems and results.

Submission of papers
--------------------

Authors are  invited to submit papers presenting original, unpublished research 
as a PDF document. There are two tracks for submission:

1. full paper (of a reasonable length),
2. extended  abstract for  poster  presentation  (maximum four pages). Typical 
   extended  abstracts  present  significant  work-in-progress,  late-breaking 
   results,  or  initial  self-dependent  contributions of students new in the 
   field.


Only electronic submissions are accepted. Papers should be written in LaTeX and
formatted according to the usual  LNCS article style which can be downloaded at
Springer's  LNCS  website
[http://www.springer.com/lncs](http://www.springer.com/lncs).  Please,  include
all source files as well as  all  additional  files  (figures etc.),  and  also
attach a PDF version of the submission.

Submissions have to be sent through the EasyChair web Page
