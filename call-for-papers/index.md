==========================================================================================================================================

Scope and location
------------------

CMC17 is the 17th edition of the International Conference on Membrane
Computing series; it is organized under the auspices of IMCS, the
International Membrane Computing Society. The conference will take
place at the city of Milan, the second largest city in Italy. Milan is
located in the north of Italy, and is one of the most active cities in
Italy concerning both commerce and cultural events. The city provides
an impressive offer of museums, art exhibitions, theaters, and
cultural events. The climate is mediterranean, with mild winters and
hot summers.

The goal of CMC17 is to bring together researchers
working in membrane computing and related fields, in a friendly
atmosphere enhancing communication, cooperation and continuing the
tradition of the past meetings. Membrane computing (P systems theory)
is an area of computer science aiming to abstract computing ideas and
models from the structure and the functioning of living cells, as well
as from the way the cells are organized in tissues or higher order
structures.

Conference format
-----------------

This edition  will have the following  format.  It will consist of: (1) one day
dedicated  to reports on specific topics  or results published  during the last
year in other conferences or scientific journals,  (2) three days of conference
with invited speakers  and short  and long contribution  talks according to the
submission  of works  and the reviews  of  the  Program  Committee,  and (3) an
Interaction  Day  similar in spirit  to  the  Brainstorming  Week  on  Membrane
Computing (BWMC)  that is  usually  organized in Sevilla  every year, where the
participants  will work  in a collaborative  way to attack  open  problems  and
propose new approaches, problems and results.

Submission of papers
--------------------

Authors are  invited to submit papers (of resonable length) presenting original, unpublished research
