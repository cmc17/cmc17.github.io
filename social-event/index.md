Social event
============

The CMC17 social event begins at Parco Sempione (Sempione Park) in the center of Milano, where we will arrive by bus from the University. There, we will reach the top of the Torre Branca (Branca Tower) with an elevator, for a view of the city from a height of about 99 meters.

After having descended the tower, we will reach an historical building, Casa degli Atellani (Atellani House). This XV century house belonged to Ludovico il Moro of the Sforza family, and was also Leonardo da Vinci’s home while he was working on his *Ultima Cena* (*The Last Supper*). We will visit the house, its park and the Vigna di Leonardo (Leonardo’s Vineyard).

We will then reach the church of San Maurizio al Monastero Maggiore on foot. This is sometimes called the “Sistine Chapel of Milano” for its rich internal decorations and its frescos.

The next stop of our tour is at the Cloister of Santa Maria Maddalena al Cerchio, the remaining testimony of an XI century monastery. This is hidden in one of the few medieval streets of the city that still maintain their original route.

We will also visit the ancient Basilica of San Lorenzo and the adjacent Chapel of Sant’Aquilino, as well as the Parco delle Basiliche (Basilicas Park). We will then cross Porta Ticinese (one of the major former city gates).

The final landmark of our tour is the renovated Darsena, a dock on the Naviglio Grande, which was part the navigable canal system that interconnected the city.

After the tour of the city, we will reach the restaurant for the CMC17 social dinner.
